# 20BPS1119_MV_DA2
I have attached my Python codes for various Image Restoration Techniques, Filters and Noises.

20BPS1119_MV_DA2.ipynb is the jupyter notebook file with all the codes.

20BPS1119_MV_DA2.html is the html version of the code along with output.

peppers.png (rgb image) and original.png (grayscale image) are the images used for testing the code.
